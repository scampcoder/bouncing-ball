# Bouncing Ball Game

A simple ball game made using JavaScript.
Creating this I learned:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*How to tie mouse movements and arrow buttons to functions to create interactivity on the screen.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*How to work with canvas to create a moving picture with canvas functions and "set interval".
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*How to reload a page.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*How to search through my own code for errors, typos, etc. to fix anything wrong.
