# Bouncing Ball Game

A simple ball game made using JavaScript.

Creating this I learned:
* How to tie mouse movements and arrow buttons to functions to create interactivity on the screen.
* How to work with canvas to create a moving picture with canvas functions and "set interval".
* How to reload a page.
* How to search through my own code for errors, typos, etc. to fix anything wrong.
